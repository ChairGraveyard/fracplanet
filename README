ABOUT
=====
Software to generate random planets and terrain with oceans, mountains, icecaps and rivers.
Parameters are specified interactively and the results displayed using OpenGL.
The generated objects can be dumped in Pov-Ray format.
Coded using C++ and STL.  Uses Qt and OpenGL libraries.  
Should build and work on any platform with these available.

BUILDING
========
This has only been tested on RH8 and RH9

Either use the traditional
 ./configure
 make

Or just have both done for you by running 
  ./BUILD
(which also adds $QTDIR/bin to the PATH while running the above commands;
this may be useful on distros which don't have qmake in the default
user path).

This will give you a "fracplanet" executable which you can run with
  ./fracplanet
or install where you like. 

BUILD OPTIONS
=============
There are already some generally effective overrides for 
Qt's fairly conservative (at least on RedHat) compile options 
in the fracplanet.pro file (where QMAKE_CXXFLAGS_RELEASE is
modified).  If you change them, do a "make distclean" before 
you rebuild to make sure Makefiles are rebuilt. 

The easiest way to get some additional CPU-specific optimisations
is to use the configuration option:
  ./configure <cpu>
where <cpu> is p3,p4 or xp as appropriate e.g ./configure p4
and rebuild from clean (again, "make distclean" is a good idea).
Note that the ./BUILD script doesn't support this option; you have 
to use configure and make. 

USAGE
=====
User documentation is contained in fracplanet.htm
If you just want to dive in all you need to know is this:
  After changing ANY of the terrain generation parameters, you must 
  hit "regenerate" to create and display a new model.
  This keeps the random seeds for terrain and river generation the same.
  There are a couple of extra buttons which also change the random seed 
  for the terrain or river network before regenerating,
  Most of the parameter entry fields have tooltips on them which 
  give an idea of what they're about.

PERFORMANCE
===========
The biggest factor influencing performance (both generation and 
display) is the degree of subdivision.  At subdivision level 8 
(for a planet) around 200MB of memory is required.  Subdivision level 9 
is not very well tested and appears to have some problems (see BUGS file).
On a 2.4GHz machine with a GeForce4 and the Nvidia OpenGL drivers display 
rates start to suffer around subdivision level 7.

When generating many rivers at high levels of subdivision, the 
river generation progress bar may stall for long periods 
(this is generally due to a large lake being formed somewhere).

INSTALL
=======
Doing 
  make install
will attempt to install the executable in 
  /usr/local/bin
and some HTML user documentation (fracplanet.htm and fracplanet.css ) in 
  /usr/local/share/doc/fracplanet

RAY TRACING OUTPUT
==================
Once you have run fracplanet and saved a planet/landscape 
(as e.g terrain.pov and terrain.inc), do e.g
  povray -Q9 -geometry 768x576 terrain.pov
Expect to get a lot of "determinant too small" messages, 
especially when using high degrees of subdivision.

BUILDING CODE DOCUMENTATION
===========================
If you have doxygen (and graphviz) and want to build the code documentation
subdirectory too, execute 
  ./mkdoc
