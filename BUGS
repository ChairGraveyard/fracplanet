- River generation can be VERY slow (especially at high levels of subdivision)
  due to the time taken to fill up large lakes (just like in the real world,
  strangely enough :^): raising the water level slightly to the level of a
  potential outflow currently necessitates adjusting the height of all the
  points in the lake, which takes a long time with big lakes.  The progress
  dialog gives a bit more feedback about this now.  It WILL complete;
  just give it time.

- Flat terrain mostly disappears when viewed from beneath due
  to back-face culling.

- In fly mode, if you fly under the cloud layer, it disappears.
  (Backface culling causes this, but without it weird things happen
  around the planet periphery when you view it from a distance.
  Fix involves changing culling state when you're below cloud altitude).
