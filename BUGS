- River generation may get stuck at high subdivisioon levels (>=9)
  Suspect precision problems with height calculation

- If the viewer is maximised, then hidden and reshown by terrain regeneration,
  it seems to be impossible to un-maximise it (needs testing on more recent Qt/
  metacity than RH8).

- Terrain (mostly) diappears when viewed from beneath.
  Nothing wrong with back-face culling, would be better to restrict tilt range.
