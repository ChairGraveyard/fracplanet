- Blender seems to ignore alpha in the cloud layer, and renders
  it as solid.  It doesn't pass per-vertex alphas out to yafray either.
  This may just be some material flag which needs setting, but haven't
  been able to discover a solution.  Any help appreciated.
  The workround is to emit an opaque pre-blended cloud layer.

- River generation can be VERY slow (especially at high levels of subdivision)
  due to the time taken to fill up large lakes (just like in the real world,
  strangely enough :^): raising the water level slightly to the level of a
  potential outflow currently necessitates adjusting the height of all the
  points in the lake, which takes a long time with big lakes.  The progress
  dialog gives a bit more feedback about this now.  It WILL complete;
  just give it time.

- Flat (non-planet) terrain mostly disappears when viewed from beneath due
  to back-face culling.

- Export to Blender doesn't support emissive terrain.
