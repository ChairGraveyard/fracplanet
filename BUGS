- The Ubuntu built packages break (some sort of vertex scrambing) when
  meshes are drawn with glDrawElements (NB the problem seems to be
  in the built app, NOT the xserver).
  This seems to be something to do with Ubuntu using (defaulting to ?)
  the mesa GL libraries and Debian using the XFree86 versions.
  dpkg-query -S /usr/include/GL/gl.h
   Sarge:  xlibmesa-gl-dev: /usr/include/GL/gl.h
   Dapper: mesa-common-dev: /usr/include/GL/gl.h 

- Base land height doesn't affect noise-only terrain 
  (when vertical perturbation is reduced to zero; probably because
  it's expressed as a proportion of vertical perturbation - should
  just be absolute).

- Blender seems to ignore alpha in the cloud layer, and renders
  it as solid.  It doesn't pass per-vertex alphas out to yafray either.
  This may just be some material flag which needs setting, but haven't
  been able to discover a solution.  Any help appreciated.
  The workround is to emit an opaque pre-blended cloud layer.

- River generation can be VERY slow (especially at high levels of subdivision)
  due to the time taken to fill up large lakes (just like in the real world,
  strangely enough :^): raising the water level slightly to the level of a
  potential outflow currently necessitates adjusting the height of all the
  points in the lake, which takes a long time with big lakes.  The progress
  dialog gives a bit more feedback about this now.  It WILL complete;
  just give it time.

- Flat (non-planet) terrain mostly disappears when viewed from beneath due
  to back-face culling.

- Export to Blender doesn't support emissive terrain.

- Doing the clouds as a mesh might seem pointless but there
  are plans to perturb the mesh to produce weather systems.
  Maybe add some height too.
