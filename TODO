- Fix river/lake hang for high subdivision levels
- Option to add Perlin noise (might make rivers meander more)
- More feedback when building display list
- Borrow some improvements from sister evolvotron project
- "man" page instead/besides HTML
- Check for OpenGL errors
- Add control over heights at which colours switch.
- Add "flight simulator" mode for getting in closer to terrain.
- Improve code documentation.
- Move terrain computation and save into separate threads so interface isn't locked.
  Or completely change GUI: make OpenGL area a separate window which goes away while
  recalculating.  Parameters still in a tabbed dialog, but replaced by nothing but
  progress meter while recalculating ?
- Rethink GUI.  Make terrain display take up most of main window
  (or be separate window, disappearing when not rendering?), with menus to access control dialogs.
- Use Qt file dialog for save.
- Clouds.
