- Ability to load/save planet parameters (simple keyword=value text file)
- Console mode app: read parameters, generate planet.
- Split up mesh file (3 parts: vertices, colours, meshing)
- Fix river/lake hang for high subdivision levels
- Option to add Perlin noise to terrain (might make rivers meander more)
  Also completely noise generated terrain.
- Continue GUI procesing when progressing.
- More feedback (progress bar?) when building display list
  (unfortunately a lot of the delay happens in OpenGL when the list is completed)
- Borrow some improvements from sister evolvotron project
- "man" page instead/besides HTML
- Check for OpenGL errors
- Add control over heights at which colours switch.
- Add "flight simulator" mode for getting in closer to terrain.
- Improve code documentation.
- New GUI: make OpenGL area a separate window which goes away while
  recalculating.  Parameters still in a tabbed dialog, but replaced by nothing but
  progress meter while recalculating ?
- Rethink GUI.  Make terrain display take up most of main window
  (or be separate window, disappearing when not rendering?), with menus to access control dialogs.
- Use Qt file dialog for save.
- Clouds.
